## self-introduction

My chinese name is mafulong, but you can call me fulong. So glad to be here and thank you for giving me this oppotunity. And I wanna gain a job like software engneer in America or England.  As for me, I graduated from central south university in china about two years ago where i majored in computer science.  

After graduation, I chose to work in bytedance as a software engineer, even if I did a lot for pursuing Master's degree, even gained the postgraduate recommendation. And I was born and raised in China. At present, maybe my spoken english is not so good but I'll express more clearly. And I think it won't be a problem when I work or live in an english environment.

Ok, would you like to know more details?

Return to my work, I have been working for about 2.5 years. In bytedance, I participated in the design and development of Notice System in TikTok that you may heard of it and another toC app in education field, named "dali" which is not famous in other countries. 

Actually, the most accomplished and influential thing I did is about Unit Test rather than some core systems I designed. Yeah, I promoted the landing of Unit Test in my department and output a best practice document for UnitTest where I summarized How to unit test, How to integrate with CI,  and designed some tools for improving efficiency. Afterward, the document was read by three thousand engineers and 10 thousand times. And some teams invited me to share how to unittest in their teams. even the inner technical college invited me to open a course named "Unit Test" . It's lucky and honored. It made me know the impact of doing one little thing best.

yeah, that's all, if u wanna know more details u can ask me, thank you.
